-- List of things that need attention in the dart-dscp-rtp draft.

- Add Paul Jones' example text to Section 5 (labelled for Section 4 in Paul's email)
- Cite and use definition of "RTP Packet Stream" from
	draft-ietf-avtext-rtp-grouping-taxonomy, section 2.1.10
- Clean up usage of "media flow" vs. "packet stream".  Latter
	should be used for protocol behavior (e.g., in Section 4),
	as "RTP packet stream".
- Add statement that a MediaStream could be carried as a single packet stream.
- General editing pass for typos, especially spacing problems.  Pick
	up Harald's "initial review" editorial comments.
- Blunter text in Section 2.4 about loss of differentiation via remarking.
	Brian Carpenter send some useful text to the list.
- Strengthen Section 2.4 language to make it clear that DSCPs/PHBs are
	*absolutely not* end-to-end, carrier/	backbone networks may not
	support many of them, and remarking to best effort (DF, all-zero DSCP)
	is a likely occurrence.  Add Brian Carpenter's point that 5-tuple
	classifiers ignore encapsulated protocol headers (as do DSCP classifiers).
- Add some sort of suggestion that better results are likely if fewer
	PHBs are used and some version of the "everything depends on the network(s)"
	comment - i.e., nothing can be assured in general, depending on how the
	networks involved are configured for DiffServ.  Ruediger's email on
	"viewpoint of one network provider" may help.
- Edits from Brian Carpenter's private email to authors.
- Rework text on what can be multiplexed on a UDP 5-tuple when
	list discussion concludes:
	+ Cannot multiplex more than one RTP session.  For now, reference
		expired I-D.westerlund-avtcore-transport-multiplexing, can remove
		that reference later.
	+ Unclear whether one or more DTLS sessions can be multiplexed.
- Add a mention of IPv6 flow label and 6-tuple as an aside, stick w/5-tuple
	term in this draft for clarity.
- Add statement that higher numbered AF classes are "better" - see AF RFC
	for language to use.
- UDP encapsulation - make it clear that encapsulated protocol (e.g., SCTP)
	may be sensitive to reordering.
- Add section on real-time traffic sensitivity to reordering, starting from
	Harald's text.
- Rework classifier discussion to make it clear what happens at edges and
	core of diffserv domains.  Use of MF and BA acronyms for classifiers
	is probably not clear to diffserv non-experts.
- Add list of people whose comments we've used.

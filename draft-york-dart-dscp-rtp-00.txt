 Limitations of Using Differentiated Services (DiffServ) With Real-time
                        Communications Protocols
                      draft-york-dart-dscp-rtp-00

Abstract

   Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and DiffServ code points (DSCP)
   can be used in some situations to provide quality of service (QoS).
   Packets with different markings can be reordered, which can cause
   poor interaction with a transport protocol that is responsive to
   reordering.  When Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams or other
   real-time media (sub-)flows are used with different DSCP values with
   the same transport 5-tuple, there may be transport protocol
   interactions.  There are also environments where the DSCP markings
   are removed or remarked.

   This document explains the limitations that exist with DiffServ when
   used with RTP in general as well in specific RTCWeb cases.

1.  Introduction

   Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and DiffServ code points (DSCP)
   can be used in some situations to provide quality of service (QoS).
   Packets with different markings can be reordered, which can cause
   poor interaction with a transport protocol that is responsive to
   reordering.  When RTP streams or other real-time media (sub-)flows
   are used with different DSCP values with the same transport 5-tuple,
   there may be transport protocol interactions.  There are also
   environments where the DSCP markings are removed or remarked.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Background on Usage of DiffServ

   Various transport protocols exist today for various reasons; mostly
   because there was a need for a behavior that the IP layer just could
   not provide, or a behavior that another transport protocol didn't
   have (at the time, in some cases).  For example, both a type of
   congestion control and an ability to reorder at the receiver out of
   order packets necessitated the need for the development of a
   transport layer to handle both capabilities better.  The result was
   TCP.  There are now multiple transport protocols (i.e., TCP, UDP,
   SCTP, etc.)  that have various behaviors.  These behaviors are not
   the same depending on the network circumstance a/each packet finds
   itself in as it traverses through the network.

   With the IP layer, and not part of the 5-tuple identifier, DiffServ
   code points (DSCP) can be used in situations to provide quality of
   service (QoS), but in fact it is a class of service (COS)
   differentiation they provide.  These 64 different values are found
   within the old TOS byte.  There is nothing in the DSCP field but
   zeros most of the time (i.e., Best Effort).  As specified within RFC
   2474 and 2475 is called a per hop behavior (PHB).  Hence most packets
   receive a best effort PHB.  An important aspect of a PHB is that it
   is just that, and a packet, and indirectly its user, needs to be
   prepared to have its DSCP remarked to another value one or more
   times, or any time it traverses a layer node.

   With the desire to now explore other than best effort DSCP markings
   of RTP streams or other real-time media (sub-)flows, certain
   realities, say for example reordering of packets within a stream or
   flow, not all transport protocols behave the same.  Some will have
   their DSCP of a non-zero value set to zero by some router before the
   destination, or another non-zero value that is different from the
   packet that it was originally set to.

3.  Background on Usage of RTP

   (This section will provide explain about the needs of RTP.

4.  RTCWEB Examples

   (This section will provide examples of DiffServ/DSCP limitations with
   regard to RTCWEB.)

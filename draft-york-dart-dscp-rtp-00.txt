Abstract

   This document describes the interaction between Differentiated
   Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality
   and real-time network communication, including communication based on
   the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  DiffServ service
   differentiation is based on network nodes applying different
   forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with
   different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs), so use of different DSCPs may
   cause transport protocol interactions (e.g., due to reordering).  In
   addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the source
   and destination of network traffic.  This document covers the
   implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network
   communication, including RTCWEB traffic.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the interactions between Differentiated
   Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality
   [RFC2475]and real-time network communication, including communication
   based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  DiffServ service
   differentiation is based on network nodes applying different
   forwarding treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with
   different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs)[RFC2474], so use of different
   DSCPs may cause transport protocol interactions (e.g., due to
   reordering).  In addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed
   between the source and destination of network traffic.  This document
   covers the implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time
   network communication, including RTCWEB traffic.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Background

   [Should this section include a general description of real-time
   communications, including RTCWEB?]

   [This paragraph needs to be expanded to better characterize the
   variety of traffic.]  For real-time network communication, the
   network traffic consists of RTP streams (or other real-time media
   (sub-)flows) that are carried in transport protocols such as UDP, TCP
   and SCTP over IP and network links.  Multiple transport protocols may
   be used via encapsulation, e.g., SCTP in UDP.  Diffserv functionality
   is applied via use of DSCPs in the DS field of the IP headers to
   select different per-hop forwarding behaviors at network nodes.

2.1.  Differentiated Services (DiffServ)

   The Diffserv architecture[RFC2475] is comprised of three primary
   functional elements that are implemented in network nodes:

   1.  a small set of per-hop forwarding behaviors (per-hop behaviors,
       PHBs),

   2.  packet classification functions, and

   3.  traffic conditioning functions including metering, marking,
       shaping, and policing.

   Complex classification and conditioning functions are implemented
   only at network boundary nodes; interior nodes apply per-hop
   behaviors to aggregates of traffic that have been appropriately
   marked using the DS field in the IPv4 or IPv6 headers [RFC2474].
   Per-hop behaviors provide a coarse grained means of allocating buffer
   and bandwidth resources at each node among competing traffic so that
   per-application flow or per-customer forwarding state need not be
   maintained within the core of the network.

   The architecture maintains distinctions among:

   o  the service provided to a traffic aggregate,

   o  the conditioning functions and per-hop behaviors used to realize
      services,

   o  the DS field value (DS codepoint, or DSCP) used to mark packets to
      select a per-hop behavior, and

   o  the particular implementation mechanisms that realize a per-hop
      behavior.

   This document focuses on usage of DSCPs and PHBs.  In the forwarding
   path, differentiated services are realized by mapping the DSCP
   contained in a field in the IP packet header to a particular
   forwarding treatment, or per-hop behavior (PHB), at each network node
   along its path.  The codepoints may be chosen from a set of mandatory
   values (the class selector codepoints), from a set of recommended
   values defined in PHB specifications, or may have purely local
   meaning.

   A per-hop behavior (PHB) is a description of the externally
   observable forwarding behavior of a network node applied to network
   traffic marked with the corresponding DSCP for that network.
   "Forwarding behavior" is a general concept in this context.  For
   example, in the event that only one DSCP is used for all traffic on a
   link, the observable forwarding behavior (e.g., loss, delay, jitter)
   will often depend only on the relative loading of the link (i.e., in
   the event that the behavior assumes a work-conserving scheduling
   discipline).  Useful behavioral distinctions are mainly observed when
   multiple traffic subsets marked with different DSCPs compete for
   buffer and bandwidth resources on a node.  The PHB is the means by
   which a network node allocates resources to traffic subsets, and it
   is on top of this basic hop-by-hop resource allocation mechanism that
   useful differentiated services may be constructed.

   The mandatory DSCPs are the class selector code points as specified
   in [RFC2474].  The class selector codepoints (CS0-CS7) extend the
   deprecated IP Precedence field in the IPv4 header; three bits are
   added, so that the class selector DSCPs are of the form 'xxx000'.
   The all-zero DSCP ('00000') designates a Default PHB that provides
   best-effort forwarding behavior and the remaining class selector code
   points were originally specified to provide relatively better per-
   hop-forwarding behavior in increasing numerical order, but:

   o  There is no requirement that any two adjacent class selector
      codepoints provide different PHBs.

   o  CS1 ('001000') was subsequently recommended for use with a "less
      than best effort" service when one is offered by a network
      [RFC3662].

   Applications and other sources of traffic cannot rely upon different
   class selector codepoints providing differentiated services or upon

   the presence of a "less than best effort" service that is selected by
   CS1.

   While Differentiated Services is a general architecture that may be
   used to implement a variety of services, three fundamental forwarding
   behaviors have been defined and characterized for general use.  These
   are basic Default Forwarding (DF) behavior for elastic traffic
   [RFC2474], the Assured Forwarding (AF) behavior [RFC2597], and the
   Expedited Forwarding (EF) behavior [RFC3246]intended for inelastic
   traffic.  Each instance of AF consists of three PHBs, with associated
   recommended DSCPs that differ only in drop precedence, e.g., AF11,
   AF12 and AF13; this set of PHBs and recommended DSCPs is referred to
   as an AF class, e.g., AF1x.  There are four recommended AF classes,
   AF1x through AF4x.  One PHB and and associated recommended DSCP are
   recommended for EF and likewise for the admission-controlled variant
   of the EF PHB, VOICE-ADMIT [RFC5865].

   In general, traffic marked with different DSCPs result in different
   DSCPs being applied.  In this case, network node reordering of
   packets with different DSCPs is possible at network nodes due to the
   use of different sets of forwarding resources for each PHB.  The sole
   exception is that the reordering is prohibited within each AF class
   (e.g., AF1x); this is because the three PHBs in an AF class differ
   solely in drop precedence.  Reordering may occur for other transient
   reasons (e.g., route flap).

2.2.  DiffServ and Transport Protocols

   Transport protocols exist to provide behaviors that cannot be
   provided at the IP layer.  For example, the need for the combination
   of reliable in-order delivery (to a receiving application) wiht
   congestion control resulted in TCP.  There are now multiple transport
   protocols (i.e., TCP, UDP, SCTP, etc.)  that provide different
   behaviors.

   [David: Need some text here on important characteristics of some
   transport protocols - the three key ones are in-order delivery,
   reliable delivery, and congestion control.  Include text on the
   importance of congestion control.  Should we limit discussion to TCP,
   SCTP, UDP here?]

   Transport protocols that provide in-order delivery and especially
   reliable in-order delivery for traffic or traffic subsets (e.g., TCP,
   SCTP) are sensitive to reordering of traffic with in the network.  At
   a minimum, when a protocol that provides reliable delivery does not
   receive the expected next packet for an ordered connection or stream,
   as indicated by receipt of a subsequent packet, it cannot deliver
   that subsequent packet.  Although waiting for the packet to arrive

Internet-Draft          Using DiffServ with RTP                 May 2014


   out-of-order is possible, reliable delivery protocols usually assume
   that the packet has been lost and respond with a retransmission
   request for the missing packet.  Transport protocols that provide
   congestion control generally use lost packets to infer congestion
   (even when ECN [RFC3168] is in use), and hence are sensitive to
   significant reordering that may be (mis-)interpreted as indicating
   congestion-caused packet loss, causing a reduction in transmission
   rate.

   [David: Say something about in-order unreliable delivery?  Is that
   germane to the real-time communication context of this draft?]

   In general, UDP is the only transport protocol that is not sensitive
   to reordering in the network, as it provides neither reliable
   delivery, in-order delivery or congestion control; UDP is a
   relatively simple multiplexing/demultiplexing protocol that provides
   multiple datagram ports for a single IP address.

2.3.  Traffic Classifiers and Remarking

   [David: Main points to make here: Network core uses BA Classifier
   (DSCP only).  Network edge uses MF classifier, typically 5-tuple,
   although RFC 2475 allows DSCP to be a classifier input.  Remarking
   occurs on aggregate/flows/packets selected by classifier.  Can lose
   differentiation at any point (backbone networks often carry a small
   number of behavioral aggregates).  Using multiple DSCPs within a
   5-tuple is asking for an MF classifier to remove that
   differentiation.]

3.  Background on Usage of RTP

   (This section will provide explain about the needs of RTP.)

   [Key point to DLB is *why* people want to do muxing in RTCWEB.  Also
   critical is the *terminology* used in RTCWEB for the different layers
   and protocols so that DLB can use appropriate terms in response.]

4.  Recommendations

   TODO

   [DY: Key point for DLB to write here - how does DiffServ apply to the
   muxing over UDP described in the section above?]

   [DLB: Within a stream for a transport protocol that is sensitive to
   reordering, i.e., everything but UDP, SHOULD only mix DSCPs/PHBs
   within a single AF class.]

5.  RTCWEB Examples

   (This section will provide examples of DiffServ/DSCP limitations with
   regard to RTCWEB.)

6.  Acknowledgements

   This document is the result of many conversations that have occurred
   within multiple RAI and TRANSPORT area working groups.  Thanks for
   review and text from James Polk.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   (Need to understand if there are any security considerations to
   include.)

   [DLB: Multiplexing of streams onto same UDP 5-tuple may not be
   expected by network operational/monitoring/security tools, making it
   easier to hide things?]

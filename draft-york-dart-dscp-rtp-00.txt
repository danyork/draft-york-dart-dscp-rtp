Abstract

   This document describes the interaction between Differentiated
   Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality
   and real-time network communication, including communication based on
   the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  DiffServ is based on network
   nodes applying different forwarding treatments to packets whose IP
   headers are marked with different DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs).  As a
   result, use of different DSCPs within a single traffic stream may
   cause transport protocol interactions (e.g., due to reordering).  In
   addition, DSCP markings may be changed or removed between the
   traffic's source and destination.  This document covers the
   implications of these DiffServ aspects for real-time network
   communication, including RTCWEB.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the interactions between Differentiated
   Services (DiffServ) network quality of service (QoS) functionality
   [RFC2475] and real-time network communication, including
   communication based on the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).
   DiffServ is based on network nodes applying different forwarding
   treatments to packets whose IP headers are marked with different
   DiffServ Code Points (DSCPs)[RFC2474].  As a result use of different
   DSCPs within a single traffic stream may cause transport protocol
   interactions (e.g., due to reordering).  In addition, DSCP markings
   may be changed or removed between the traffic's source and
   destination.  This document covers the implications of these DiffServ
   aspects for real-time network communication, including RTCWEB
   traffic.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Background

   [Editor's note: Should this section include a general description of
   real-time communications, including RTCWEB?]

   [Editor's note: The following paragraph needs to be expanded to
   better characterize the variety of types of traffic, and probably
   generalize beyond RTP.]

   For real-time network communication, the network traffic consists of
   RTP streams (or other real-time media (sub-)flows) that are carried
   in transport protocols such as UDP, TCP and SCTP over IP and network
   links.  Multiple transport protocols may be used via encapsulation,
   e.g., SCTP in UDP.  DiffServ functionality is applied via use of
   DSCPs in the DS field of the IP headers to select different per-hop
   forwarding behaviors at network nodes.

2.1.  Differentiated Services (DiffServ)

   The DiffServ architecture is intended to enable scalable service
   discrimination in the Internet without the need for per-flow state
   and signaling at every hop or node.  A variety of services may be
   built from a small, well-defined set of building blocks that are
   deployed in network nodes.  The services may be either end-to-end or
   intra-domain; they include both those that can satisfy quantitative
   performance requirements (e.g., peak bandwidth) and those based on
   relative performance (e.g., "class" differentiation).  Services can
   be constructed by a combination of:

   o  classifying traffic and setting bits in an IP header field at
      network boundaries or hosts,

   o  using those bits to determine how packets are forwarded by the
      nodes inside the network, and

   o  conditioning the marked packets (e.g., metering, marking, shaping,
      policing) at network boundaries in accordance with the
      requirements or rules of each service.

   The requirements or rules of each service are set through
   administrative policy mechanisms.  A network node that supports
   DiffServ includes a classifier that selects packets based on the

   value of the DS field in IP headers, along with buffer management and
   packet scheduling mechanisms capable of delivering the specific
   packet forwarding treatment indicated by the DS field value.  Setting
   of the DS field and fine-grain conditioning of marked packets need
   only be performed at network boundaries; internal network nodes
   operate on traffic aggregates that share a DS field value or in some
   cases, a small set of related values.

   The DiffServ architecture[RFC2475] is comprised of three primary
   functional elements that are implemented in network nodes:

   1.  a small set of per-hop forwarding treatments or behaviors (per-
       hop behaviors, PHBs),

   2.  packet classification functions, and

   3.  traffic conditioning functions including metering, marking,
       shaping, and policing.

   The architecture maintains distinctions among:

   o  the service provided to a traffic aggregate,

   o  the conditioning functions and per-hop behaviors used to realize
      services,

   o  the DS field value (DS codepoint, or DSCP) used to mark packets to
      select a per-hop behavior, and

   o  the particular implementation mechanisms that realize a per-hop
      behavior.

   This document focuses on PHBs and the usage of DSCPs to obtain those
   behaviors.  In a network node's forwarding path, the DSCP contained
   in a field in the IP packet header is mapped to a particular
   forwarding treatment, or per-hop behavior (PHB) that specifies the
   forwarding treatment.

   A per-hop behavior (PHB) is a description of the externally
   observable forwarding behavior of a network node applied to network
   traffic marked with the corresponding DSCP for that network.  In this
   context, "forwarding behavior" is a general - for example, if only
   one DSCP is used for all traffic on a link, the observable forwarding
   behavior (e.g., loss, delay, jitter) will often depend only on the
   relative loading of the link.  To obtain useful behavioral multiple
   traffic subsets are marked with different DSCPs for different PHBs to
   which node resources such as buffer space and bandwidth are
   allocated.  PHBs provide the framework for a DiffServ network node to

   allocates resources to traffic subsets, and useful differentiated
   services are constructed top of this basic hop-by-hop (per-node)
   resource allocation mechanism.

   The codepoints (DCSPs) may be chosen from a set of mandatory values
   (the class selector codepoints), from a set of recommended values
   defined in PHB specifications, or may have purely local meaning.  The
   mandatory DSCPs are the class selector code points as specified in
   [RFC2474].  The class selector codepoints (CS0-CS7) extend the
   deprecated IP Precedence field in the IPv4 header; three bits are
   added, so that the class selector DSCPs are of the form 'xxx000'.
   The all-zero DSCP ('00000') designates a Default PHB that provides
   best-effort forwarding behavior and the remaining class selector code
   points were originally specified to provide relatively better per-
   hop-forwarding behavior in increasing numerical order, but:

   o  There is no requirement that any two adjacent class selector
      codepoints provide different PHBs; adjacent class selector
      codepoints may use the same pools of resources on each network
      node in some networks.

   o  CS1 ('001000') was subsequently recommended for "less than best
      effort" service when such a service is offered by a network
      [RFC3662].  Not all networks offer such a service.

   Applications and traffic sources in general cannot rely upon
   different class selector codepoints providing differentiated services
   or upon the presence of a "less than best effort" service that is
   selected by the CS1 DSCP.

2.2.  Diffserv PHBs (Per-Hop Behaviors)

   Although Differentiated Services is a general architecture that may
   be used to implement a variety of services, three fundamental
   forwarding behaviors (PHBs) have been defined and characterized for
   general use.  These are:

   1.  Default Forwarding (DF) for elastic traffic [RFC2474].  The
       Default PHB is always selected by the all-zero DSCP.

   2.  Assured Forwarding (AF) [RFC2597] to provide differentiated
       service to elastic traffic.  Each instance of the AF behavior
       consists of three PHBs that differ only in drop precedence, e.g.,
       AF11, AF12 and AF13; such a set of three AF PHBs is referred to
       as an AF class, e.g., AF1x.  There are four defined AF classes,
       AF1x through AF4x.

   3.  Expedited Forwarding (EF) [RFC3246]intended for inelastic
       traffic.  Beyond the basic EF PHB, the VOICE-ADMIT PHB [RFC5865]
       is an admission controlled variant of the EF PHB.

2.3.  DiffServ and Transport Protocols

   [Editor's note: This section is centered on TCP, UDP, and SCTP.  It
   will need some generalization to include other important transport
   protocols - DCCP is a likely one to include, although it is not
   necessary to include every known transport protocol.]

   Transport protocols provide data communication behaviors beyond those
   possible at the IP layer.  An important example is that TCP provides
   reliable in-order delivery of a data stream with congestion control.
   SCTP provides additional properties such as preservation of message
   boundaries, and the ability to avoid head-of-line blocking that may
   occur with TCP.  In contrast, UDP is a basic unreliable datagram
   protocol whose primary functionality is port-based multiplexing and
   demultiplexing on top of IP.

   Transport protocols that provide in-order delivery and especially
   reliable in-order delivery for traffic or traffic subsets (e.g., TCP,
   SCTP) are sensitive to network reordering of traffic.  At a minimum,
   when a protocol that provides reliable in-order delivery does receive
   a packet other than the next expected packet for an ordered
   connection or stream, it cannot deliver that subsequent packet.  In
   this situation, such protocols usually assume that the expected
   packet has been lost and respond with a retransmission request for
   that packet.  In addition, congestion control functionality in
   transport protocols usually infers congestion when packets are lost,
   creating an additional sensitivity to significant reordering - such
   reordering may be (mis-)interpreted as indicating congestion-caused
   packet loss, causing a reduction in transmission rate.  This remains
   true even when ECN [RFC3168] is in use, as extreme congestion may
   still cause packet losses, which transport protocols react to as
   indicating congestion.  Congestion control is an important aspect of
   the Internet architecture, see [RFC2914] for further discussion.

   In general, marking traffic with different DSCPs result in different
   PHBs being applied at network nodes, making reordering possible due
   to use of different pools of forwarding resources for each PHB.  The
   major exception is that the reordering is prohibited within each AF
   class (e.g., AF1x); this is because the three PHBs in an AF class are
   required to differ solely in drop precedence.  Reordering within a
   PHB or AF class may occur for other transient reasons (e.g., route
   flap).  UDP is the primary transport protocol that is not sensitive
   to reordering in the network, because it does not provide reliable
   delivery, in-order delivery or congestion control.

2.4.  Traffic Classifiers and DSCP Remarking

   [David: Main points to make here: Network core uses BA Classifier
   (DSCP only).  Network edge uses MF classifier, typically 5-tuple,
   although RFC 2475 allows DSCP to be a classifier input.  Remarking
   occurs on aggregate/flows/packets selected by classifier.  Can lose
   differentiation at any point (backbone networks often carry a small
   number of behavioral aggregates).  Using multiple DSCPs within a
   5-tuple is asking for an MF classifier to remove that
   differentiation.]

   DSCP markings are not end-to-end in general.  Each network is free to
   make its own decisions about what PHBs to use and what DSCP
   corresponds to each PHB.  While every PHB specification includes a
   recommended DSCP, and RFC 4594 [RFC4594] recommends their end-to-end
   usage, beyond the class selector codepoints, there is no requirement
   that every network support any other PHBs or use any DSCPs.  When
   DiffServ is used, the edge or boundary nodes of a are responsible for
   ensuring that all traffic entering a network conforms to that
   network's policies for DSCP and PHB usage; this network ingress
   traffic conditioning is a function of the classification, marking and
   related traffic conditioning functionality at network boundaries
   mentioned in Section 2.1 and is an important element of the DiffServ
   architecture, see [RFC2475].  Hence DSCP remarking is possible at any
   network boundary, including the first network node that traffic sent
   by a host encounters.

   The traffic classifiers that are used for this purpose often do not
   look beyond the traffic's 5-tuple (source and destination IP
   addresses, transport protocol, source and destination ports).  This
   is the case even though the definition of MF classifiers (Multi-Flow
   classifiers) in RFC 2475[RFC2475] allows arbitrary fields as input -
   in practice, the DSCP is typically not one of those fields.  As a
   result, when multiple DSCPs are used for network traffic that shares
   a 5-tuple, remarking at a network boundary may result in all of the
   traffic being forwarded with a single DSCP, removing any
   differentiation within the 5-tuple beyond the point at which this
   remarking occurs.

   [Editor's note: Even an AF class doesn't fare well, as the AF->AF
   remarking may be "color-blind" as opposed to "color-aware" - not sure
   whether this level of detail belongs in this draft.]

   Backbone and other carrier networks may employ a small number of
   DSCPs (e.g., less than half a dozen) in order to manage a small
   number of traffic aggregates; hosts that use a much larger number of
   DSCPs may find that much of the intended differentiation is removed
   by such networks.

3.  Background on Usage of RTP

   (This section will provide explain about the needs of RTP.)

   [Key point to DLB is *why* people want to do muxing in RTCWEB.  Also
   critical is the *terminology* used in RTCWEB for the different layers
   and protocols so that DLB can use appropriate terms in response.]

4.  Recommendations

   TODO

   [DY: Key point for DLB to write here - how does DiffServ apply to the
   muxing over UDP described in the section above?]

   [DLB: Within a stream for a transport protocol that is sensitive to
   reordering, i.e., everything but UDP, SHOULD only mix DSCPs/PHBs
   within a single AF class.]

   (This section will provide examples of DiffServ/DSCP limitations with
   regard to RTCWEB.)

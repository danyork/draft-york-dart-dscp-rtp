                      draft-york-dart-dscp-rtp-00

Abstract

   This document explains the interaction between DiffServ, DiffServ
   Code Points (DSCP) and real-time communication protocols such as the
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).  This document explains the
   limitations that exist with DiffServ and DSCP when used with RTP in
   general as well as in specific RTCTWEB cases.

1.  Introduction

   Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and DiffServ code points (DSCP)
   can be used in some situations to provide quality of service (QoS).
   Packets with different markings can be reordered, which can cause
   poor interaction with a transport protocol that is responsive to
   reordering.  When RTP streams or other real-time media (sub-)flows
   are used with different DSCP values with the same transport 5-tuple,
   there may be transport protocol interactions.  There are also
   environments where the DSCP markings are removed or remarked.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Background

   [DLB: Describe protocol stack, from RTP streams (or other real-time
   media (sub-)flows down to RTP, UDP, IP.  DSCP is in the IP header -
   reference RFC 2474 for that and then RFC 2475 for Diffserv in
   general.  Make sure to cite requirements that DSCPs be individually
   treated by network nodes.]

2.1.  Differentiated Services (DiffServ)

   [DLB: Next two paragraphs are copied from RFC 2475:]

   This architecture is composed of a number of functional elements
   implemented in network nodes, including a small set of per-hop
   forwarding behaviors, packet classification functions, and traffic
   conditioning functions including metering, marking, shaping, and
   policing.  This architecture achieves scalability by implementing
   complex classification and conditioning functions only at network
   boundary nodes, and by applying per-hop behaviors to aggregates of
   traffic which have been appropriately marked using the DS field in
   the IPv4 or IPv6 headers [DSFIELD].  Per-hop behaviors are defined to
   permit a reasonably granular means of allocating buffer and bandwidth
   resources at each node among competing traffic streams.  Per-
   application flow or per-customer forwarding state need not be
   maintained within the core of the network.  A distinction is
   maintained between:

   o  the service provided to a traffic aggregate,

   o  the conditioning functions and per-hop behaviors used to realize
      services,

   o  the DS field value (DS codepoint) used to mark packets to select a
      per-hop behavior, and

   o  the particular node implementation mechanisms which realize a per-
      hop behavior.

   Service provisioning and traffic conditioning policies are
   sufficiently decoupled from the forwarding behaviors within the
   network interior to permit implementation of a wide variety of
   service behaviors, with room for future expansion.

   [DLB: Next paragraph copied from RFC 2475, will need editing to make
   terminology more accessible.]

   A per-hop behavior (PHB) is a description of the externally
   observable forwarding behavior of a DS node applied to a particular
   DS behavior aggregate.  "Forwarding behavior" is a general concept in
   this context.  For example, in the event that only one behavior
   aggregate occupies a link, the observable forwarding behavior (i.e.,
   loss, delay, jitter) will often depend only on the relative loading
   of the link (i.e., in the event that the behavior assumes a work-
   conserving scheduling discipline).  Useful behavioral distinctions
   are mainly observed when multiple behavior aggregates compete for
   buffer and bandwidth resources on a node.  The PHB is the means by



York, et al.            Expires October 03, 2014                [Page 3]

   which a node allocates resources to behavior aggregates, and it is on
   top of this basic hop-by-hop resource allocation mechanism that
   useful differentiated services may be constructed.

   [DLB: Next two paragraphs copied from RFC 4594.]

   While Differentiated Services is a general architecture that may be
   used to implement a variety of services, three fundamental forwarding
   behaviors have been defined and characterized for general use.  These
   are basic Default Forwarding (DF) behavior for elastic traffic, the
   Assured Forwarding (AF) behavior, and the Expedited Forwarding (EF)
   behavior for real-time (inelastic) traffic.  The facts that four code
   points are recommended for AF and that one code point is recommended
   for EF are arbitrary choices, and the architecture allows any
   reasonable number of AF and EF classes simultaneously.

   The terms "elastic" and "real-time" are defined in [RFC1633],
   Section 3.1, as a way of understanding broad-brush application
   requirements.  This document should be reviewed to obtain a broad
   understanding of the issues in quality of service, just as [RFC2475]
   should be reviewed to understand the data plane architecture used in
   today's Internet.

   [DLB: Add discussion of class selector code points, see RFC 2474.
   Add a warning here that while CS1 is intended for less than best
   effort, that's not what always happens - many networks do not support
   a less-than-best-effort PHB.]

2.2.  DiffServ and Transport Protocols

   Various transport protocols exist today for various reasons; mostly
   because there was a need for a behavior that the IP layer just could
   not provide, or a behavior that another transport protocol didn't
   have (at the time, in some cases).  For example, both a type of
   congestion control and an ability to reorder at the receiver out of
   order packets necessitated the need for the development of a
   transport layer to handle both capabilities better.  The result was
   TCP.  There are now multiple transport protocols (i.e., TCP, UDP,
   SCTP, etc.)  that have various behaviors.  These behaviors are not
   the same depending on the network circumstance a/each packet finds
   itself in as it traverses through the network.

   [DLB: Suggest removing next two paragraphs.  I'm not sure COS vs.
   QoS distinction is useful here]

   With the IP layer, and not part of the 5-tuple identifier, DiffServ
   code points (DSCP) can be used in situations to provide quality of
   service (QoS), but in fact it is a class of service (COS)



York, et al.            Expires October 03, 2014                [Page 4]

   differentiation they provide.  These 64 different values are found
   within the old TOS byte.  There is nothing in the DSCP field but
   zeros most of the time (i.e., Best Effort).  As specified within RFC
   2474 and 2475 is called a per hop behavior (PHB).  Hence most packets
   receive a best effort PHB.  An important aspect of a PHB is that it
   is just that, and a packet, and indirectly its user, needs to be
   prepared to have its DSCP remarked to another value one or more
   times, or any time it traverses a layer node.

   With the desire to now explore other than best effort DSCP markings
   of RTP streams or other real-time media (sub-)flows, certain
   realities, say for example reordering of packets within a stream or
   flow, not all transport protocols behave the same.  Some will have
   their DSCP of a non-zero value set to zero by some router before the
   destination, or another non-zero value that is different from the
   packet that it was originally set to.

   [DLB: Discuss effect of reordering on transport protocols.  In
   general any congestion controlled protocol is sensitive to
   reordering, UDP is the notable exception, as it's mux/demux only, no
   congestion or flow control.]

   [DLB: Discuss PHB/DSCP reordering effects - AF's use of multiple PHBs
   and DSCPs in an AF class PHB Group (e.g., AF2x) does not cause
   reordering, as they differ only in drop precedence; in general, all
   other usage of different PHBs may cause reordering.]

3.  Background on Usage of RTP

   (This section will provide explain about the needs of RTP.

3.1.  RTP, UDP, DiffServ and 5-tuples

   [DLB: This is where the RTP/UDP multiplex onto a single 5-tuple
   discussion goes.  It gets followed by a warning that MF classifiers
   (see RFC 2475) are unlikely to look at DSCP within 5-tuple, and hence
   are likely to remove differentation within 5-tuple - this gets put in
   context by pointing out that DSCP remarking is common, and hence
   differentiation can vanish for all sorts of other reasons.]

4.  Recomendations

   TODO

   [DLB: Within a stream for a transport protocol that is sensitive to
   reordering, i.e., everything but UDP, SHOULD only mix DSCPs/PHBs
   within a single AF class.]

   [DLB: Here's where the text about mixing DSCPs (aside from single AF
   class) on a UDP 5-tuple goes - it needs to point back to 3.1 with a
   warning.]

5.  RTCWEB Examples

   (This section will provide examples of DiffServ/DSCP limitations with
   regard to RTCWEB.)

6.  Acknowledgements

   This document is the result of many conversations that have occurred
   within multiple RAI and TRANSPORT area working groups.  Thanks for
   review and text from James Polk, TODO.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   (Need to understand if there are any security considerations to
   include.)

   [DLB: Multiplexing of streams onto same UDP 5-tuple may not be
   expected by network operational/monitoring/security tools, making it
   easier to hide things?]
